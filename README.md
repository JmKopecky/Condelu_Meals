Used libraries: 
* FontAwesome
* Spring Boot
* Thymeleaf
* SCSS
* GSAP
* GSAP ScrollTrigger

IDEA: 
* Barba.js - animated transitions between pages


Sitemap: 
* home page
* menu page
  * select item
  * edit item
  * add to cart
  * EACH ITEM SHOULD HAVE A PROMINENT OPTION TO SEE NUTRITION FACTS
* Order page
  * view cart (and navigate back to the menu page to make an order)
  * view previous orders
  * place order and check out
* Meal plan page
  * create/edit a meal plan

Broad Technical Ideas: 
* Database to store customer data, reviews, etc
* System for users to create meal plans, letting them order rapidly when on that plan. 
* Full workflow to order, just don't actually fulfil. 
* Basically we pretend we are a real resturaunt site.
